# CopyCat Challenge

## Requirements

- A clear README that explains how to run your code and any assumptions that you have made when building your solution
- Concise, well-documented and maintainable code that solves the problem without over engineering it
- An approach that suits the language(s) that you have chosen for the solution

## Challenge Brief

- Taking the screenshot we've included, reproduce the layout for a desktop web browser.
- Try to get all the components in the correct place while using semantic markup.
- Think about how your markup affects accessibility and how the layout will work on different devices.

## Details

### Introduction

This is a Publicis Sapient graduate challenge for the case study interview.
It is a copy cat challenge where I copied the screenshot layout provided in the source folder.
This code is built on HTML for creating webpage and CSS for styling the webpage without using any framework.

The html code is built with semantic elements keeping accessability in mind.
The layout is designed for different devices and divided into 2 different range of width -

1. Less than 768px (for small, mid size mobiles and tablets).
2. 768px or more (for big tablets, landscape orientation and desktops).

### How to use?

To download this code, you can choose one of the following options -

- clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yashikanand/copy-cat.git
- Download zip: clicking on Code > Download Zip

After the code is available in the local repository, you can choose one of the following options -

Option 1.

- Open the folder you have store the files.
- Open index.html for running the code on local server.

Option 2.

- Open the folder in the Visual Studio Code.
- Using the extension "Live Server", create the local server and using your preferred browser, the website will be available on http://127.0.0.1:5500/ or http://localhost:5500/ (depending upon the port shown in live server)

### Assumptions

1. The quote(content on the right hand side in screenshot) is supposed to be shown at the end of the blog content on screen with width 768px or less.
2. No clickables on the website. (No information for target link provided with screenshot)

### Testing

The website is tested manually on local server using the inspect element to test different screen sizes.

The cross browser compatibility is tested manually on Google Chrome and Safari Browser.
