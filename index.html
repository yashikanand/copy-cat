          The moment I fell in love with frontend development was the moment I
          discovered the <code>style.css</code> file in WordPress themes. I
          could (can!) change a handful of lines and totally change the look and
          feel of a website—and that, in turn, can alter the way you feel about
          a piece of writing, make you feel more comfortable buying tickets to
          an event, or increase the likelihood youʼll share something with your
          friends. Frontend development is at the intersection of art and logic,
          business and expression, left brain and right brain, design and
          nerdery. I love it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a job title, “frontend developer” is fairly well-defined and
          understood. As long as the job is building websites, frontenders are
          focused on the browser. Even as the job has changed over the decades,
          we’ve remained browser people. But there’s a pile of new stuff we’re
          now expected to do, particularly if we’re building a site with a
          modern JavaScript framework like React, Angular, or Vue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though they (and their makers) differ when it comes to syntax and
          approach, all modern frameworks agree in one critical way: Everything
          is a component. Even native JavaScript is moving toward its own model
          of web components. And I like it, this idea of components. You nest
          and piece them together as needed, which allows you to construct the
          abstractions that make the most sense for what you’re building. Your
          <code>card</code> component does all the stuff your real-life card
          needs to do. Your <code>form</code> component does forms the way your
          website needs to do forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, components are a new concept to old developers like me; all
          this custom component creation has turned me into a site-level
          architect. Components in JavaScript have taken hold in a way that
          components on the server side never did. I’ve worked on (and still
          work on) many a WordPress website where the closest I came was
          breaking templates into little <code>include()</code> statements. I’ve
          worked on Ruby on Rails sites with partials that take a handful of
          local variables. Those are useful for building reusable parts, but
          they’re a far cry from the robust component models that JavaScript
          frameworks offer us.
        </p>
        <p>
          This style of frontend development has really become full-stack
          development, and components are at the heart of it—so letʼs get into
          how they work.
