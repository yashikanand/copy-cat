        The moment I fell in love with frontend development was the moment I
        discovered the style.css file in WordPress themes. I could (can!) change
        a handful of lines and totally change the look and feel of a website—and
        that, in turn, can alter the way you feel about a piece of writing, make
        you feel more comfortable buying tickets to an event, or increase the
        likelihood youʼll share something with your friends. Frontend
        development is at the intersection of art and logic, business and
        expression, left brain and right brain, design and nerdery. I love it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a job title, “frontend developer” is fairly well-defined and
        understood. As long as the job is building websites, frontenders are
        focused on the browser. Even as the job has changed over the decades,
        we’ve remained browser people. But there’s a pile of new stuff we’re now
        expected to do, particularly if we’re building a site with a modern
        JavaScript framework like React, Angular, or Vue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though they (and their makers) differ when it comes to syntax and
        approach, all modern frameworks agree in one critical way: Everything is
        a component. Even native JavaScript is moving toward its own model of
        web components. And I like it, this idea of components. You nest and
        piece them together as needed, which allows you to construct the
        abstractions that make the most sense for what you’re building. Your
        card component does all the stuff your real-life card needs to do. Your
        form component does forms the way your website needs to do forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, components are a new concept to old developers like me; all this
        custom component creation has turned me into a site-level architect.
        Components in JavaScript have taken hold in a way that components on the
        server side never did. I’ve worked on (and still work on) many a
        WordPress website where the closest I came was breaking templates into
        little include() statements. I’ve worked on Ruby on Rails sites with
        partials that take a handful of local variables. Those are useful for
        building reusable parts, but they’re a far cry from the robust component
        models that JavaScript frameworks offer us.
      </p>
      <p>
        This style of frontend development has really become full-stack
        development, and components are at the heart of it—so letʼs get into how
        they work.
